- be able to retrieve historical currency conversion rates
- show a chart of daily currency rates for a selected list of target currencies (multi-select)
- 'correct' handling of currency rates in Javascript

#### Non functional requirements:

- Implement the necessary logic/wrapper to cover the limitation of the free plan provided by `currencylayer-client`.

## your stack

Try to use a modern JS stack, e.g. React or Vue. You can use any boilerplate or framework you like, for React we recommend create-react-app or next.js, for Vue you could for instance use nuxt.js. If you prefer it this way, you can sprinkle your code with some typescript, but this is not a must.

## optionals

Local storage, unit tests, PWA, anything you want to show off...
